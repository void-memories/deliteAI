## Overview

We're solving a significant challenge in the mobile applications AI ecosystem: the lack of discoverability and reusability of AI components. Imagine finding an AI app with an outstanding feature, like high-quality text-to-speech, but needing to rebuild it from scratch because you can't isolate that one component.

DeliteAI Agents solve this by encapsulating complex AI functionalities into ready-to-use packages that run entirely on-device, ensuring privacy and performance.

## Core Features

All agents are built on the DeliteAI SDK and provide a consistent set of powerful features:

-   **On-Device AI Processing**: Ensures user privacy and delivers low-latency performance without relying on the cloud.
-   **High-Level APIs**: Simplifies integration, allowing you to add complex AI features with just a few lines of code.
-   **Background Processing**: Capable of running tasks efficiently in the background, even when the app isn't active.
-   **Persistent Storage**: Built-in support for storing and managing results locally.
-   **Cross-Platform**: Designed for seamless integration across both Android/Kotlin and iOS/Swift.

## The Agents Marketplace

The DeliteAI Agents Marketplace is the central hub where developers can discover, integrate, and combine a growing library of agents.

### How the Marketplace Empowers Developers

-   **Simple Integration**: Add a dependency to your project to instantly integrate powerful AI capabilities.
-   **No Heavy Lifting**: Pre-built agents handle complex model management, configurations, and platform-specific optimizations.
-   **Discoverable & Reusable**: Easily find and reuse agents across different projects and applications.

### Upcoming Marketplace Agents

We are continuously expanding the marketplace with new foundational and productivity-focused agents:

-   **Core Functionality**: TTS, ASR, on-device LLM execution, and general-purpose summarization.
-   **Productivity**: Intelligent agents for managing emails, calendars, and other common tasks.

## Available Agents

### Notifications Summarizer

Automatically processes and summarizes device notifications at scheduled times using on-device language models. Even when the device is locked, the agent can activate, retrieve notifications, and prepare a concise summary.

-   [Android Implementation](notifications_summarizer/android/README.md)

## The Power of Agent Combinations

The true potential of the marketplace emerges when you combine multiple agents to create sophisticated workflows that would otherwise be difficult to build.

**Morning Briefing System**:
```
Notification Summarizer + TTS Agent + ASR Agent
→ Summarizes overnight notifications → Reads summary aloud → Responds to voice commands
```

**Smart Email Assistant**:
```
Email Reader + LLM Execution + TTS Agent
→ Processes emails → Generates responses → Reads important messages aloud
```

**Intelligent Content Pipeline**:
```
ASR Agent + LLM Execution + Summarizer + TTS Agent
→ Voice input → AI processing → Content summarization → Audio output
```
